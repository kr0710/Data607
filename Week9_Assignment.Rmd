## Overview
I set up an account with the NYT's developers site and received a key to use with their APIs. For my API request, I selected the a request for the most shared articles on Facebook over the last day. The data is successfully requested, converted to JSON format, then into a tibble data frame.
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

#Request data using the API and key

get_data = GET('https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/shared/1/facebook.json?api-key=w2X519QicS6R0N4GE5W8ja2aCgSUk7bL')

# Print request response

get_data

#Convert content to JSON format, then to tibble

json_data <- fromJSON(rawToChar(get_data$content))

json_df <- tibble(json_data$results)

#print data frame

kable(json_df)


```
